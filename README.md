This is my solution to the Moonshot project (project 8) in the [100 Days Of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/) tutorial created by Paul Hudson ([@twostraws](https://github.com/twostraws)). Updated for challenge 1 to include the launch date below the mission badge. The challenge 2 update included a filtered mission list at the bottom of the astronaut view to show in which ones he participated.
